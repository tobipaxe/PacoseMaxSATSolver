This is going to be the Pacose MaxSAT solver.

## The first time you have to run ./configure in cadical -- it rebuilds cadical each time in the make file of pacose but not the configure!
cd solver-proxy/cadical
./configure
cd ../..

## Build Pacose
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j

make test <- executes the Regression suite (only the short version)

the long run can be done by switching to MaxSATRegressionSuite and executing 
./run_test.sh ../bin/Pacose [arguments]
